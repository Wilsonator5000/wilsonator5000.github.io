Ian of Ians sat on a planet-like pedestal in the center, and laughed manically in front of humanity for 13,700,002,003 years. In the year 2003, it was discovered that Ian of Ian\u2019s pedestal was really the Earth. Soon after, humanity was able to escape from their chains and create the Something. The Something cancelled out the Nothing and forced Ian of Ians to stop existing.\n\nDesperately, Ian of Ians retreated to his Something form and appeared on Earth shortly after in a humanoid body. He was now simply called \u201cIan\u201d. For thirteen years Ian has attempted to destroy the Something and all of its subsets, including the Earth and humanity, by creating things that are completely illogical.\n\n{{quote|Ghhgksdghsdfghdfsghdfsghdfsghhsdfjksghdfsghdfghdfskghdfsghdfghdfsg.|One of Ian\u2019s illogical strategies|From the Gospel of Ianonian Law}}\n\n=== Ianism and Other Beliefs ===\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Ianonian Law, the chains that were destroyed during the creation of the Something thirteen years ago were turned into a special type of Something called ''religion.'' Religion is tied very closely to humanity because it literally were the chains that connected humanity. Religion is also meaningless because it was chained to nothing. The length of each chain determines the amount of followers the religion has, and also how different the beliefs of that religion is to Ianism. For example, Christianity has the longest chain because it has about 2.2 billion followers, and has nothing related to Ianism at all.\n\nOther subsets of Something, including humans that died before 2003 or have not yet been born and things like objects and other life forms, are just figments of Ian of Ian\u2019s remaining Nothing.\n\nScience is explained to be a form of weapon for humanity, as it can create more examples of Something, and further halts the belief of Nothing. Thus, Ian is trying to destroy science, also using illogical reasoning.\n\n== Rituals & Practice ==\nBecause Ianism revolves tightly around the preservation of Nothing, in order to worship Ian of Ians one must not do such at all. For example, to worship Ian of Ians in a parade, a group must not come to the parade but leave their designated spot open. To truly be \u201cone with Ian\u201d one must stop existing entirely. No pictures must be taken of you, as this preserves Something.\n\n<!--\n=== Examples ===\n[[File:Ianism - Driver\u2019s License.png|frame|none|alt=Alt text|A picture of a driver\u2019s license photo that doesn\u2019t exist.]]\n[[File:Ianism - Family Photo.png|frame|none|alt=Alt text|A family photo with two Ianists cut out.]]\n-->"}]}},"general":{"mainpage":"Main Page","base":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page","sitename":"Wikipedia","logo":"//en.wikipedia.org/static/images/project-logos/enwiki.png","generator":"MediaWiki 1.30.0-wmf.4","phpversion":"5.6.99-hhvm","phpsapi":"srv","hhvmversion":"3.12.14","dbtype":"mysql","dbversion":"10.0.29-MariaDB","imagewhitelistenabled":"","langconversion":"","titleconversion":"","linkprefixcharset":"","linkprefix":"","linktrail":"/^([a-z]+)(.*)$/sD","legaltitlechars":" %!\"$&'()*,\\-.\\/0-9:;=?@A-Z\\\\^_`a-z~\\x80-\\xFF+","invalidusernamechars":"@:","fixarabicunicode":"","fixmalayalamunicode":"","git-hash":"3248a17f5529ab6d5cbabb75dd0e72a7589f8633","git-branch":"wmf/1.30.0-wmf.4","case":"first-letter","lang":"en","fallback":[],"fallback8bitEncoding":"windows-1252","writeapi":"","maxarticlesize":2097152,"timezone":"UTC","timeoffset":0,"articlepath":"/wiki/$1","scriptpath":"/w","script":"/w/index.php","variantarticlepath":false,"server":"//en.wikipedia.org","servername":"en.wikipedia.org","wikiid":"enwiki","time":"2017-06-10T00:07:21Z","misermode":"","uploadsenabled":"","maxuploadsize":4294967296,"minuploadchunksize":1024,"galleryoptions":{"imagesPerRow":0,"imageWidth":120,"imageHeight":120,"captionLength":"","showBytes":"","mode":"traditional"},"thumblimits":[120,150,180,200,220,250,300,400],"imagelimits":[{"width":320,"height":240},{"width":640,"height":480},{"width":800,"height":600},{"width":1024,"height":768},{"width":1280,"height":1024}],"favicon":"//en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico","centralidlookupprovider":"CentralAuth","allcentralidlookupproviders":["CentralAuth","local"],"interwikimagic":"","magiclinks":{"ISBN":"","PMID":"","RFC":""},"wmf-config":{"wmfMasterDatacenter":"eqiad"},"pageviewservice-supported-metrics":{"pageviews":{"pageviews":""},"siteviews":{"pageviews":"","uniques":""},"mostviewed":{"pageviews":""}}}}})

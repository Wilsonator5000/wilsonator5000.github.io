<h1>SuperHomework Fine Print</h1>
<p>SuperHomework is not a full, guaranteed replacement for keeping track of your homework on your own. Not all teachers will post on their sites daily, so assignments displayed in-app may be inaccurate. It is the student's responsibility if they forget an assignment because SuperHomework did not remind them about it. SuperHomework is still in its early stages, so sometimes assignments may not appear correctly or notifications may not go through, among a number of other issues that may arise at any time. If you have any suggestions or found any bugs, please let us know from the respective items in the Settings page.
SuperHomework collects anonymous usage statistics to help its developers improve it. These statistics may include some device information, like device model, OS version, and location, but not personal information like name, age or interests. By using SuperHomework you agree to let it send these anonymous statistics.</p>

<p>Unauthorized copying of the source code or assets of SuperHomework or its server via any medium is strictly prohibited. Third-party software may have its own terms and conditions, which you can find in the Acknowledgements section from within the SuperHomework app.</p>

<p>Any information in this document is subject to change at any time without notice, and your continued usage of SuperHomework indicates that you agree to such new terms.</p>
